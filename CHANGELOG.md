# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Scans every workspace folder with `saw scan` on startup, on save, and when a file that can run
  code changes on disk; also on demand with **saw: Scan Workspace**.
- Findings in the Problems panel, a verdict per folder in the status bar and the saw view.
- Works in Restricted Mode, and warns before you trust a folder saw found infected.
- Finds `saw` on `PATH` or in `~/.local/bin` and checks its version. When it is missing or too old,
  installs it with pipx without asking, installing pipx first if needed; a failed install says why
  and what to run, with **Retry** and **Copy Diagnostics**. **saw: Install or Repair saw** and the
  `saw.autoInstall` setting.
- On Windows, where saw does not run yet, says so and points to WSL instead of installing it.
- **Fix…** on an infected folder runs `saw fix` after you confirm, in Restricted Mode too, shows
  its report in a terminal and scans the folder again. Nothing is pushed.
- **saw: Audit This Machine** runs `saw audit` and repeats its verdict on whether changing
  credentials is safe; the saw view keeps the last one.
- The saw view shows whether saw's scan-on-clone git hooks are in place, and installs or repairs
  them.
- Scans again after a checkout, pull, merge or rebase.
- Installs stayawakebot 0.13.0, and moves a saw it installed earlier up to it.
- A read-only `saw_folderVerdict` tool for AI agents in the editor: the folder's verdict from a scan
  of the latest changes, with the instruction to stop and ask you unless it is clean or residue.

### Fixed

- A notification left open no longer holds up the next scan of its folder.
